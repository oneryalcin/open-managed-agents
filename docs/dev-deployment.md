# Development and deployment setup

This document is the practical entry point for running OMA locally and for
thinking about how the current runtime shape should become a real deployment.
It is deliberately boring: the Make targets are thin wrappers around the
commands already used in the repo.

## Local development

From the repo root:

```bash
make install
make typecheck
make test
```

The useful targets are:

| Target | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make check` | `typecheck` followed by the Vitest suite. |
| `make ui` | Serve the read-only Managed Agents Console. |
| `make server` | Run the CWC example OMA server on `OMA_PROBE_PORT` (default `40178`). |
| `make docker-smoke` | Run the existing deterministic Docker-local deployment smoke. |
| `make parallel-docker-smoke` | Start multiple Docker-local sandboxes concurrently without calling a model. |
| `make cwc-smoke` | Run the Python SDK CWC happy-path smoke against the local server. |
| `make gated-smoke` | Run the Python SDK ask-gated builtin-tool smoke. |

`make server`, `make docker-smoke`, and `make parallel-docker-smoke` require a
working local Docker daemon. `make cwc-smoke` and `make gated-smoke` also need
the Python example environment and a reachable OMA server. The example `.env`
file lives at `examples/ship-your-first-managed-agent/.env.example`.

## Docker's role

Docker is currently necessary for the `docker-local` sandbox provider. It is
not necessary to run the control-plane process itself during local development.
The safer local shape is:

1. run the OMA HTTP process on the host;
2. let OMA create one Docker sandbox container per live session;
3. keep the Docker socket out of the sandbox containers.

A Dockerized control-plane container is possible, but it creates a separate
security decision: if that container needs to launch sandbox containers, it
usually needs access to the host Docker socket. Treat that as a local-dev-only
convenience unless a future ADR explicitly accepts the risk.

## Parallel sessions today

The Pi runner keeps runtime handles in a session-keyed map. Different sessions
can have distinct Docker-local sandbox containers and can run concurrently in
one process. A single session is different: while its handle is running, another
user message is sent as a Pi follow-up rather than as a second independent
turn.

`make parallel-docker-smoke` is the cheap proof path for the current local
worker shape. It creates `OMA_PARALLEL_SMOKE_SESSIONS` Docker-local sandbox
providers concurrently, writes session-specific files under
`/mnt/session/outputs`, collects those files, checks `/workspace` execution, and
verifies container cleanup.

This does not prove production concurrency. It does prove the local Docker
provider can hold several isolated session sandboxes at once without spending
model tokens.

## Production shape

The current MVP is suitable for local development and single-node demos. A real
deployment should split responsibilities. Follow-up work is tracked in
[#103](https://github.com/oneryalcin/open-managed-agents/issues/103).

1. **Control plane:** HTTP API, SSE, request validation, session state, event
   append/replay, custom-tool and confirmation orchestration.
2. **Durable metadata store:** agents, environments, sessions, event rows, file
   metadata, runtime ownership, and pending waits. SQLite is fine for local
   single-node work; a multi-instance deployment needs a durable store with the
   same owner/generation fencing semantics.
3. **Object storage:** uploaded files, internal snapshots, and session outputs.
4. **Runtime workers:** a pool that owns live turns and talks to the sandbox
   provider. Docker-local is the single-node provider. Remote providers such as
   Modal or Kubernetes pods should be separate worker backends, not an
   afterthought inside the API route.
5. **Admission controls:** per-workspace/session concurrency limits, sandbox
   quotas, model-provider rate-limit handling, and cleanup/reconciliation.

The current owner/generation ledger is the right starting point for a worker
pool, but multi-owner production needs the liveness checks to move into the
same durable commit boundary as state changes.
